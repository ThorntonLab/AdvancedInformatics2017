# Week 3: Rstudio, Jupyter notebooks, and publication-quality graphics

Background materials:

* [Rstudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* [Rstudio tutorial](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~gulzar/rstudio/basic-tutorial.html) from UCLA
* [Jupyter project](http://jupyter.org/)
* [Jupyter quickstart guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

[Lecture notes](LabNotebooks.html)

For the lab this week, we will work through this [set of exercises](http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rgraphics/Rgraphics.html).

If you know ggplot well already and/or have time, work through
[this](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/dplyr_tutorial.html) tutorial about dplyr.

Useful free resources:

* [ggplot tutorial](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/) from 2014.

Books:

* [R for data science](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/)
* [ggplot book](https://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/331924275X)
* Basically anything by Hadley Wickham is the future of nice stuff for R.
